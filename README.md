# Maze_Make_Solve
Maze Maker is a Python project that generates and solves a random solvable maze using Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Features ðŸš€  
âœ… Maze Generation** â€“ Creates a random solvable maze of a given size.  
âœ… Maze Solving** â€“ Implements DFS to find a path from start to finish.  
âœ… CLI Output** â€“ Displays the maze using `0s` (walls) and `1s` (paths).  
âœ… Visualization** â€“ Uses **Matplotlib** to display the solved maze.  
âœ… It provides both **command-line (CLI) output** and **visual representation** using Matplotlib.
